The object (OBJ) file of the 3d logo (created with Vectary) is availbale in the directory as a [zip file](obj.zip).

Colors used for the plane:
  - `#fff`
  - `#e8e8e8`
  - `#f9f0ff`
  - `#888`
  - `transparent`

The blender version of logo was created by Mojtaba.

Adobe Dimension 2020 did not support importing SVG images.
So, I imported the M logo in Vectary, extruded it and exported to *OBJ* format
and then used the object file in Adobe Dimension.
See the [procedure section below](#Procedure) for how to import SVG in Vectary.


[Vectary](https://www.vectary.com/) is an online tool.
Its legacy *Studio 3.0 (2020)* version is used.
The *Camera 1* is the one used for new photos.

### Procedure
First I modified the svg of my *M* logo and converted the strokes to paths in Inkscape.
Then I imported the svg into Vectary.
Then I selected *Geometery* button from right panel.
Then below that button, I extruded the shape to my desired value.
Then selected the result object and from *Library* tab on top left selected a material.
The color of the material can be changed in the right panel.
The color `#ffcd1a` seems to be a good choice.
Then I added a *Rectangle light* and positioned it in my desired place and resized it to be bigger.
(Actually the light is not needed at all. the Screenshot 13 to 17 did not use light at all).
Then I added a *SquarePlane* as the background plane of my object.

See [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/oFt_eeGuhjo) from Vectary to learn more.

To change the plane color in Vectary, select it and change its color.
We can also change the color of environment by selecting *Object* tab on top left corner
and from right panel change the environment color.
