These are created with the online tool [Vectary](https://www.vectary.com/).

The legacy *Studio 3.0 (2020)* is used.
The *Camera 1* is mainly used for photos.

First I modified the svg of my *M* logo and converted the strokes to paths in Inkscape.
Then I imported the svg into Vectary.
Then I selected *Geometery* button from right panel.
Then below that button, I extruded the shape to my desired value.
Then selected the result object and from *Library* tab on top left selected a material.
The color of the material can be changed in the right panel.
The color `#ffcd1a` seems to be a good choice.
Then I added a *Rectangle light* and positioned it in my desired place and resized it to be bigger.
(Actually the light is not needed at all. the Screenshot 13 to 17 did not use light at all).
Then I added a *SquarePlane* as the background plane of my object.

Colors used for the plain: `#fff`, `#e8e8e8`, `#f9f0ff`, `#888`, and `transparent`.

See [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/oFt_eeGuhjo) from Vectary to learn more.

The object (OBJ) file has been exported and is availbale in the directory as a [zip file](obj.zip).

To change the plane color, select it and change its color.
We can also change the color of environment by selecting *Object* tab on top left corner
and from right panel change the environment color.
